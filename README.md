# sfml-retro-games
A collection of classic retro-style games developed in C++ using the SFML library.

## Games Included

- **Pong**: Classic 2-player paddle game.
- **Tic Tac Toe**: Simple X/O board game.

## How to Build and Run

Each game is in its own folder with build instructions and dependencies.

To get started, navigate to a game folder, build it using:

```sh
make
```
Then run the executable as explained in that game's README.

Instructions for Mac are listed but customisation of Makefile's to the correct paths for SFML libraries can also make the game work.
